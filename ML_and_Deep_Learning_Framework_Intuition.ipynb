        "### **Supervised Learning :** In supervised learning , we have data and labels. Machine Learning algorithms tries to use the data to predict label. If it guesses the label wrong , the algorithm corrects itself and trying again. This act of correction is why it is called supervised.\n",

        "### **Unsupervised Learning :** Unsupervised learning has data but no labels. For example , you might have the purchase history of all customers at your store , and your marketing team wants to send out a promotion for next summer , but they know not everyone will be interested in new summer clothes. They come to you and ask , Do you know who is interested in summer clothes? And the thing is , you dont either. But you know you can figure it out from the data you have so you decide to run algorithm to find patterns in the data and group customers who purchase similar things together.Once it finishes , you notice two groups. One group of customers who purchase only during winter time and one group of customers who purchase mostly during summer time. You label them winter customers and summer customers and send them to your marketing team. Important to note here is that you provided the labels , They werent there to begin with , but the patterns were. Problems like this are also called as clustering or putting groups of similar examples together.\n",
