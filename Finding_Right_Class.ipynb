            "this protocol implements the storage of encryption keys of all access points. It is also called FT (Fast Transition). When the client migrates to a new access point, it is no need to perform encryption keys agreement again. This standard considers 2 types of FT mode - Over the Air (OTA) and Over the DS (OTD). OTA - client communicates with the access point to which it wants to connect through the air. This function is always enabled in Keenetic. You can't disable it. OTD - client communicates with the access point to which it wants to connect before the migration begins via the access point to which it is connected at this moment. In the first versions of the 11r protocol, only Over the DS mode was supported, and some older phones, such as the iPhone 4s on iOS, only support Over the DS. By default, OTD mode is disabled. You can enable this feature via the Command-line interface (CLI). Modern smartphones usually support Over the Air and choose this mode for roaming. As to the FT settings - the user should perform them manually. You have to pay attention that the same IDs and mobile domain keys for all routers of the local network segment must be set. There could be a slight pause during the voice session when the FT mode is enabled, but it won't cause the session break.\n",
